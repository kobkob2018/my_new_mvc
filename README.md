The CRUDor MVC system enterprise
====================

I would like to invite contributors to participate and help the building of this very simple, yet beautyfull system that I currently construct.

// at the bottom of this post I will put some tasks list of where you can help and fill in some codes.

it is written in php and mysql and it is based on simple MVC methodology.

but here, the main focus and most affords are put in to simplify and straight foreword all CRUD functionality.

talking about form creation on the fly, straight attached to a mysql table.

talking about field validation server side before saving, files uploads and saving all at once, and all you have to do is to write very few lines of code. where all the validation, files upload etc.. are taken care of in the background.

this project also gives a very vast permissions handling, called handle_access. it is mapping access for controllers a and each function in it, based on users log-in or logout, user types and rolls given for each function.

I know it sounds complicated to write such access_handling, but thanks to a cascading defaults fallback mechanism it is really simple to do.

you, actually don't have to worry about this at all!! unless you want to add special access to specific functionality. it is done with very few lines of code, inside the controller, inside the handle_access() function.

well.. this was a short description of what this system can do and there is much more to it...

so what do I need from you contributors?

one thing I need help with is commenting functions and describing what they do. this is one thing I keep failing to do. basically I do worry about naming the functions in a way that the name tells the whole story of what the function can do. so it is easy to understand but I really could help some commenting as well.

another thing I like to plan some multy language translation mechanism

I will put more task in the comments bellow in the future

So it is an open source, ofcourse! and i store it in github, an a public repository,so you can easilly clone and start commiting changes.
